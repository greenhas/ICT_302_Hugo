I recently received a very kind email from someone who was looking for one of the posts on my old WordPress blog that detailed an [Alfred 3](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow I'd written to generate a standard peer review checklist (the academic/manuscript kind, not the student/course project kind) based on [Snyder's](https://twitter.com/DressageProf) (2018) [*How to become a more effective reviewer*](https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0016986218754495). 

The email was nice not only because it showed that someone was actually reading my old blog but also because it was the kick in the pants I needed to upload that Alfred workflow and several others to GitHub, which I'd been meaning to do for a while. This is a pretty niche GitHub repository, since it assumes use of Alfred (and frequently also Things 3), but it's available [here](https://github.com/greenhas/academic-alfred-workflows) if you're interested.

One of the things I'm trying to work on as a new assistant professor is to standardize and organize my work so that, as much as possible:

- my efforts are organized around discrete projects (which is inspired by David Allen's [**Getting Things Done**](https://gettingthingsdone.com/), people who use GTD, and the productivity software I useâ€”which is frequently also inspired by GTD),
- those projects are guided by checklists so that I don't forget any important stepts (which is inspired by Atul Gawande's [*The Checklist Manifesto*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto)), 
- each of those projects has a clear place in my had drive/cloud storage (which is based on a tweet I saw once but can't find right now), and 
-  it's easy to review the status of and next steps for any particular project (which is another GTD idea). 

I'm not (yet) particularly good at realizing the full potential of a system like this, but the benefit I have realized so far has been great, and I can see even more benefit from sticking to it more closely. So, even though my particular approach is built on two particular technology platforms, I'd like to write more about these workflows in general, technology-agnostic terms in the future.
