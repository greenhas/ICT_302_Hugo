![A picture of my desk as I work on manuscript revisions](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/supplies-for-responding-to-reviewer-5.jpg)

- plenty of desk space (I [nearly turned down the chance](http://impodstersyndrome.libsyn.com/episode-10-new-digs-and-should-i-go-to-this-conference) to get a windowed office next year because I'd lose this desk space)
- ~60 pages of printed manuscript, tables, figures, and reviewer comments for fine-grained editing, making sure my in-text citations match my ref list (which is the stack of papers fanned out across the top), checking figures and tables, and proofreading
- a big stack of sticky notes so that I could keep track of what changes I was making in response to which reviewer comments (in preparation for my response letter)
- a laptop playing GoPro footage uploaded to YouTube from a train traveling from Zurich to Geneva at full screen, because it provides a nice view and good white noise (and, frankly, because I'd rather be there instead)
- all of the inspirational pictures and other mementos that I can find (and have previously put up in my office, because the editor wants this back tonight, so I don't have time to put up new ones)
- a water bottle
