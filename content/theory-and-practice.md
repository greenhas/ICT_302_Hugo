You are the interdisciplinary faculty of the Department of Action and Adventure in the College of Cinematic Academia. Your mission is to produce research, get grant funding, teach your students, grow your major, and defend the good name of the university against the state legislature. Department Chair and Professor of Questionable Archaeology Henry Jones, Jr. went to meet with the dean two weeks ago and hasn't been seen since, leaving you to fend for yourselves.

## Players: Create Characters

1. Choose a cinematic genre that describes your character: action, adventure, pulp fiction, espionage, science fiction, superhero, etc.
2. Choose an academic discipline that describes your character: probably the one on your diploma or in your department name.
3. Choose your number, from 2 to 5. A high number means you’re better at theory (knowing things, understanding situations, predicting actions or outcomes, figuring out a plan). A low number means you’re better at practice (doing things, changing situations, completing actions or outcomes, executing a plan).
4. Give your character a cool action-adventure academic name, like Tweed McRocketson or Ada Lovelace.
**You have**: a typical conference outfit, a tool or resource you use in your research, and a textbook related to your field. Because this is action-adventure academia, each of these should have hidden gadgets or unrealistic capabilities as befits the cinematic genre that you've chosen
**Player goal**: Get your character involved in crazy academic adventures and try to make the best of them.
**Character goal**: choose one or create your own: 
- become department chair,
- network with potential collaborators,
- get revenge on reviewer 2,
- develop new theory,
- solve practical problems,
- get tenure,
- or keep being awesome (you have nothing to prove)

## Players: Describe Your Department

As a group, pick two strengths for your department: well-funded, lots of graduate students, good reputation, popular major. 
Also, pick one problem: old and/or cramped building, bad relationship with other units in the college, 

## Rolling the Dice

When you do something risky, roll 1d6 to find out how it goes. roll +1d if you’re prepared and +1d if you’re an expert (the GM tells you how many dice to roll, based on your character and the situation). roll your dice and compare each die result to your number.
⬇ If you’re using theory, you want to roll under your number.
⬆ If you’re using practice, you want to roll over your number.
0️⃣ **If none of your dice succeed**, it goes wrong. The GM says how things get worse somehow.
1️⃣ **If one die succeeds**, you barely manage it. The GM inflicts a complication, harm, or cost. 
2️⃣ **If two dice succeed**, you do it well. Good job!
3️⃣ **If three dice succeed**, you get a critical success! The GM tells you some extra effect you get. 
*️⃣ **If you roll your number exactly**, you have **SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTH THEORY AND PRACTICE**. You get a special insight into what’s going on. Ask the GM a question and they’ll answer you honestly. some good questions:
- What are they really feeling? 
- Who’s behind this?
- How could I get them to _____?
- What should I be on the lookout for? 
- What’s the best way to _____?
-  What’s really going on here?
You can change your action if you want to, then roll again.
**HELPING**: if you want to help someone else, who’s rolling, say how you try to help and make a roll. if you succeed, give them +1d.
